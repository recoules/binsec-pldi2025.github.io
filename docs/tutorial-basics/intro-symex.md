# Symbolic execution in a nutshell

In this chapter, we are going to learn how to configure the **BINSEC* symbolic execution engine to explore the different behaviors of small binary program.

## <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-backward" /> Previously on Fibonacci

Last chapter was introducing the basic reverse-engineering information we can read from the tiny ELF executable `fibonacci` <a href="/bin/fibonacci" download><Icon icon="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down" /></a>.
As a reminder, the following gives you an overview of the file content as read by **BINSEC**.

## <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-play" /> Concrete emulation

Putting aside the *Symbolic* in *Symbolic execution* ends up with straight execution: not the fastest nor the most robust, but enough to play with small machine code, even if it does not match your processor.

Here, we can evaluate the computation of the fibonacci sequence of the eponymous function.
```c
int fibonacci(int);
```

:::info

The `x86-64` calling convention states that the first (*integer'like*) arguments are given, in order, via the registers `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8` and `r9`.
The result is returned in the register `rax`.

:::

We can feed **BINSEC** with the following script.

<Sample
    Model={Snippet1}
    height="10em"
    width='100%'
    value=''
    filename= 'fibonacci'
    binary={fibonacci}
    noinfo>
    Download <a href="/snippet/fibonacci_script_1.ini" download><Icon icon="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down" /></a> or copy the content of the script in the file `fibonacci_script_1.ini`, then run the following command.
    ```bash
    binsec -sse -sse-script fibonacci_script_1.ini fibonacci
    ```
    ```plain title="Output"
[sse:result] Path 1 reached address 0x0040008e (<fibonacci> return) (0 to go)

               total          8
               true           5
               false          2
               constant enum  1
             
             Satisfiability queries

               unsat          0
               unknown        0
               time           0.00
               average        -nan
             
           Exploration
             total paths                      1
             completed/cut paths              0
             pending paths                    1
             stale paths                      0
             failed assertions                0
             branching points                 6
             max path depth                   24
             visited instructions (unrolled)  24
             visited instructions (static)    9
```
</Sample>

Here, the script is close to the natural language:
- the first line moves the initial instruction pointer to the value of the symbol `<fibonacci>` (i.e. `0x400078`);
- the second line initialize the register `rdi`, i.e. the function argument according to the calling convention ();
- the last line add the address of the function return (i.e. `0x4000b5`) to the goal of the analysis.
If the address is reach, the engine will print the value of the register `rax` (return value).

:::tip

You can adjust the value of the argument by using the slider.

:::

## <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-play" /> Input-Output inversion

Let us reintroduce the *symbolic* in the equation!
Instead of choosing a concrete input value for `rdi`, we will give some freedom to the symbolic engine.
Symbolic execution is able to provide an input witness, called "*model*", for each program path it covers, i.e. an assignment for the symbolic variables we can feed to the program to follow the given path.
Thus, it means we can query the tool to find a set of inputs that triggers a special condition.

Here, we can use the following script to find the input number which produces a given fibonacci sequence value.

<Sample
    Model={Snippet2}
    height="10em"
    width='100%'
    value=''
    filename='fibonacci'
    binary={fibonacci}

    noinfo

             visited instructions (unrolled)  24
             visited instructions (static)    9
```
</Sample>

:::warning

A `reach` does not prevent the execution to go past its address.
To avoid the exploration to go outside the `fibonacci` code, we add the `cut` instruction, so the execution will stop at the fibonacci return address even if the condition is not met.

:::

:::note

Any non-initialized location (registers and memory) is implicitly treated as symbolic by **BINSEC**. Yet, you can not reliably use or constraint them in the script without a name. Thus, it is recommended to always explicitly initialize the program variables either with concrete values or symbolic declarations.

:::

## <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-play" /> Path enumeration

Up to now, we were looking for a precise, single goal. But, we can also use the symbolic execution to just explore and report all the way to reach a given address.

Here, we will use the `reach*` goal which stands for *reach all*.

:::note

**BINSEC* symbolic execution runs until either all the goals are fulfilled or there is no other valid successor state to execute.
As consequences:
- a single goal script will stop as soon as it reach its target;
- a script without any goal will stop immediately;
- an infeasible or infinite goal prevents the exploration to stop before its worklist exhaustion.

:::

:::tip

Here, we use an assumption to reduce the valid range of value for `n` . It should be the preferred way to limits the search space of the analysis.

:::

## <Icon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-play" /> Bounded verification

Last but not least, if we are able to exhaustively explore all the paths of a program up to a given bound, we can all along verify nothing wrong will happen under this scope.

For instance, we may wonder what is the upper limit for `n` until our fibonacci computation is correct. Indeed, the fibonacci sequence grows exponentially while the implementation use fixed 64-bit values.

:::info

Beside the actual result, the x86 arithmetic instructions also update the condition flags, including the carry flag `cf` and the overflow flag `of`. The addition instruction `add` sets these flags when the, respectively unsigned and signed results do not fit in the destination operand.

</Sample>

Here, we put an assertion to test the overflow flag `of` just after the execution of the `add` instruction. If **BINSEC** terminates its exploration without raising an alarm, we have the guaranty the no overflow will happen up to the chosen limit. Yet, starting from `93`, the assertion fails, meaning the program output is no longer reliable.

:::tip

The `explore all` command ensure the exhaustive enumeration of the program paths. It makes clear the goal of the script and will never been optimized out in the future.
